## What is Probbility?
> Probability is a mathematical language for quantifying uncertainty

## Distribution 

### X ~ Binomail(n, p)
e.g. n indentical events with equal probalility p, X describe the number of success

### X ~ Poisson(x)
e.g. x is the average time for something happen

### ... many other

## Probability Theory
- Assume the probalbilty is known: a family of distribution/parameters (mean, sd)
- we can evaluate P(x = k) or P(a < x < b)

- Independence: P(x1..xn) = $product of P(x_1)P(x_2)...P(x_n)$ OR $P(x_i | x_j) = P(xi)$
- Conditional Independence: P(x1..xn|) = $product of P(xi|y)$
- Baye's Rule: $P(x|y) = P(x) P (y | x) / P(y)$
