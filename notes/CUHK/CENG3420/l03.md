# RV32I Unpriviledged Integer Register

Return address ra/x1
: before function call, save the return address in ra

Stack pointer sp/x2
: Pointes to logical top of the stack


Global pointer gp/x3
: Hold the base register of memory

Function arguments a0-a7/x10-x17
: holds the argument of a function call, extra (>8) are pushed into stack
