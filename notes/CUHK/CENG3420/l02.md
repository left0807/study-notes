# ISA

ISA -> abstract interface between hardware and lowest level software
ISA + OS = ABI
ABI -> defines a standard for binary portability across computer

# RISC-V 

RISC - reducted (ARM)
CISC - complex (x86)

today boundary not clear

## 6 base instruction formats

- all 32-bit wide
- R, I, S, B, U, J

- Operands of arithmetic op must be a 32-bit register (32-bit == a word)

### Register

x0 - zero / zero constant
x1 - ra / return address
x2 - sp / stack pointer
x3 - gp / global pointer
...
x18-27 - s2-s11 / saved resigster
x28-x31 - t3-t6 / temporaries
