Logic
: evaluate argumeents: distinguish good/bad reasoning

Formal logic
: comprehensive system for evaluating arguments
ie. for **any kind of arguments that could exist** this system provide an evaluation

syllogism
: 三段式 =>
: All As are Bs <br>
 <u>Some Cs are As</u> <br>
 Some Cs are Bs

: e.g.
All mammals are vertebrates <br>
<u>Some sea creatures are nannals</u> <br>
Some sea creatures are vertebrates <br>
-> all arguments of this form are **good argument**

: 三段式 have 2^3 = 64 combination (All, Some, No), 16 of them are good

Informal Logic
: case-by-case<br>
具體的用法<br>
具體內容<br>
具體使用者<br>

: some arugment contain fallacy, but **can't tell from the form**<br>
e.g. <br> 
All factories (A) are plants (B) <br>
<u>All plants (B) are things that contain chlorophyll (C)</u> <br> 
all factories (A) are things that contain cholorophyll (C) <br>
Here plants have different meaning in 1st and 2nd sentance


## The Ontological Argument (by St. Anselm)

> God is the greatest being
> Nothing greater can be conceived
> An existing God is greater than non-existing God
> God must exist


## Kant's Objection: 'Existence' is Not a Perdicate (存在並非性質）

A existing god === a non-existing god

```
被語言文法欺騙
e.g. 
高基全是肥的 (肥 -> bachelor)
神是存在的

<--<-

- real predicate: is one which can be used to help define what something is.
- 'bachelor (單身漢)' is a unmarried male -> 20 found
+ happy
- bachelor is a happy unmarried male -> 15 found

happy -> real predicate for bachelor

find bachelor v.s. find existing bachelor 
- They are the same

exist is not predicate
```

> 存在是量詞

$ \exists \forall $ -> 量詞
